## Core Features

*   **Live Glitch Effects:** Instantly transform your webcam or uploaded images/videos.
*   **Interactive Controls:** Sliders to dial in your desired level of visual chaos.
*   **Video Recording:** Capture your sessions in H.264 or HEVC (H.265).
*   **Media Upload:** Process your own images and video files.
*   **Motion-Reactive & Trail Effects:** Visuals that respond and smear.
*   **Frame Freezing & Randomization:** For finding those perfect glitches.
*   **Responsive:** Works on desktop and mobile.

## Tech Stack

*   HTML / CSS / Vanilla JS
*   WebGL (GLSL shaders)

## What's Next

I'm planning to add more shader effects, audio reactivity, and preset saving/loading. Got more cool projects on the way too.
